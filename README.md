# Beach-Volleyball-Canada-End-to-End-Project
This project is my Capstone Project, which required us to create a dashboard analyzing the similarities and differences of the ranked teams according to FIVB.

This project involved:
  1. Cleaning the initial data (in Tabular form) we got from the client
  2. Analysing requirement versus data availability
  3. Communicating updated requirements to the customer
  4. Customers responded to us by sending their whole database (in Tabular form).
  5. I had to clean the data again, make sense of the data, and make changes to the Objective according to the newly available data.
  6. Once done with this, I had to web scrape a lot of the data according to customer needs as the raw data sent in step 4 was not enough according to the requirement.
  7. I learned how to use web scraping using the Selenium library in Python.
  8. I implemented the web scraping scripts and then cleaned and manipulated the data.
  9. I implemented the visualizations on Power BI. These viz showed how teams compared to each other in terms of their cumulative height, weight, and tournament wins across different tournaments.

All in all, this was an inside peak on how real-time projects might function. How different stakeholders misinterpret the same data and requirements.
